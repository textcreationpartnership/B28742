            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>REASONS</hi> Humbly offered by the Soap makers of the City of <hi>London</hi> to the Honourable the House of Commons in Parliament assembled against a Duty to be laid upon Soap.</head>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1st.</hi> THat the Excise of Soap in the time of the late Civil Wars amounted but to about 7000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> after all Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Collecting paid.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> That since the present War with <hi>France,</hi> the Excise of Soap being discoursed of, it was thought more convenient to lay a Duty upon the Commodities it was made of, they being more easie to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect at the Custome House, and accordingly a great Duty was laid upon the Ingredients of which Soap is made, to the value of about a half peny <hi>per</hi> pound (being 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Barrel) by reason whereof, and of the present War, the Commodities are so dear, that the Trade of Soap is much decayed in <hi>London,</hi> for that in many Counties espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the North and West, the Chandlers and others privately make Cake Soap, Ball Soap, and white Soap of Wood and Fern Ashes and Kitchen-stuff, and the like, which much lessens the sale of Soap in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That if any Excise be laid upon Soap it will cause many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make Soap in private, which will much lessen the Revenue, and tend to the Ruin of those that honestly pay the Duty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That Soap in <hi>London,</hi> being made of Olive Oyl and foreign Pot-ashes, and Tallow, which Commodities are the return of Fish, Cloath, Lead, Tin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A new Duty will make Soap so very dear, that the sale of it will be much lessened, and consequently the Exportation of these Commodities will be very much lessened also.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That if a Duty be laid upon Soap it will subject the Soap-makers to great grievance, by Officers continually Night and Day disturbing their Houses, as is well remembred by some Soap-makers, who were Traders in the time of the late Civil Wars.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That there being already great Duties laid upon the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, Soap is made of, as aforesaid, if an Excise be now laid on Soap it will be taxing the Labouring and Manufacturing of the Commodity, and a great Grievance to great numbers of poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who depend upon the said Trade, and those that use Soap, and what is got by the will in great measure be lost by the other.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the Multitude of Officers necessary to look after this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all parts of <hi>England</hi> will be such a very great charge and lyable to so much corruption that the Duty will signifie very little to the ends for which it is designed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which</hi> Reasons <hi>considered it is humbly hoped this Honourable House will be pleased to lay aside an Excise upon Soap.</hi>
